In this repository is code and other stuff from my YouTube tutorial
[`3D with Kivy`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP19bggXJC494N7o6DUDJJQ1djJi-k3V-).

The tutorial is done mainly in Python 2.7, but I try to make the code
as compatible as possible with Python 3.

### Installation

You'll need three main components:

* [Python(2.7, 3.x)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Kivy](https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation.html) (preferably
   the latest one)
* [Kivy3](https://github.com/KeyWeeUsr/kivy3)

    $ pip install https://github.com/KeyWeeUsr/kivy3/zipball/master
